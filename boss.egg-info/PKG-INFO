Description: # BOSS Package
        
        This is a package for performing Bayesian Optimziation over String Spaces (BOSS)
        It accompanies Moss et al. 2020 and provides notebooks to recreate all the experiments.
        
        The code is built upon the emukit Bayesian optimziation library. We recommend following their tutorials to get started (https://github.com/amzn/emukit/tree/master/notebooks)
        
        
        We currently support the following spaces:
        
        1) unconstrained strings of fixed-length
        2) locally-constrained strings of fixed-length
        3) strings of varied length following constraints given by a context-free grammar
        4) a candidate set of strings of varied length
        
        and provide implementations for the following surrogate models:
        
        1) Gaussian process with a linear kernel applied to a one-hot-encoding of strings
        2) Gaussian process with an RBF kernel applied to a bag-of-ngrams representation of strings
        3) Gaussian process with an SSK kernel
        4) Gaussian process with a split SSK kernel (for scaling SSK to long strings)
        5) Random search
        
        
        Genetic algorithm acqusiiton function optimzies are provided for each space type (except the space of a candidate set of strings).
        
        
        This package will be continually developed, with soon-to-be-added features including:
        
        1) Implementations of SSK for GPUs
        2) New scalable versions of SSKs for very long sequences (like genes>10^4)
        3) Support for tree and graph kernels, to measure  similarity between other discrete structures
